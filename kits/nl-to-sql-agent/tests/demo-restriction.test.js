/**
 * Demo Question Restriction Tests
 *
 * Verifies the server-side allowlist that restricts demo sessions to the
 * approved example questions. These tests exercise the REAL production helper
 * (apps/lib/demo-questions.ts) rather than a local copy, so the allowlist,
 * normalization, and approval logic cannot drift from production.
 *
 * Also verifies the fail-closed demo restriction policy (Issue #1): a logged-in
 * session whose isDemo value is missing/undefined must never be treated as an
 * unrestricted non-demo session.
 *
 * 1. Approved questions are accepted.
 * 2. Normalized variants (case, whitespace, trailing punctuation) are accepted.
 * 3. Unsupported / near-but-different questions are rejected.
 * 4. Normalization is an exact match, not semantic matching.
 * 5. Missing/undefined isDemo resolves to demo-restricted (fail closed).
